    hashlib is used instead of Python built-in method hash()
    in order to guarantee a stable/well-defined hash algorithm

    Since Python 3.3, PYTHONHASHSEED=random is the default setting, which
    randomizes the seed used for salting the hash() function to prevent DoS
    attacks that exploit hash collisions.

    See http://ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html.

    Python 3.4 further improves the default hash algorithm (PEP 456).
